A Tactical Perspective
Real Madrid could overpower Arsenal‚Äôs‚ÄÇflanks early, opening a 4-2-4 lead. Valverde and Modric will battle for midfield dominance, and‚ÄÇMbapp√© and Vin√≠cius will try to spring an occasional counterattack. It will be a literal, high‚ÄÇpressing fight.
After absorbing pressure and compact defensively,‚ÄÇArsenal most frequently counter with Saka and Martinelli. With Rice and parley tucked in up front, set pieces are no longer an essential‚ÄÇweapon.
