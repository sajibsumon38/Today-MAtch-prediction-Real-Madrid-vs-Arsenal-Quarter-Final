A Tactical Perspective
Real Madrid could overpower Arsenal’s flanks early, opening a 4-2-4 lead. Valverde and Modric will battle for midfield dominance, and Mbappé and Vinícius will try to spring an occasional counterattack. It will be a literal, high pressing fight.
After absorbing pressure and compact defensively, Arsenal most frequently counter with Saka and Martinelli. With Rice and parley tucked in up front, set pieces are no longer an essential weapon.
Crucial Information
They have never scored a goal against Arsenal in European competition.
Real Madrid has never recovered from three goals down in a round of 16 knockout phase game in the Champions League.
